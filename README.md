# CPSC544-Project
## Building
Ensure you have apache ant installed.

Run `ant` to compile the program, download dependencies (if required), and build the jar file. 

Run `ant clean` to delete the build directory and the built jar file

Run `ant resolve` if you only want to download the the dependency jars into the lib directory
